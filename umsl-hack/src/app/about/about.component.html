      <h2>What is UMSL|HACK?</h2>
      <br />
      <h4>
        UMSL|HACK is an annual hackathon hosted by the Information Systems
        Department at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. UMSL|HACK's main
        goal is to create a platform to challenge/encourage college students to
        apply their skills by building an application in 36 hours! We know how
        valuable hackathons are to college students, while it might be
        intimidating to have a running application in the allotted time, we work
        very hard to provide participants with all the mentoring and help they
        need to get their app running. We hope by participating in UMSL|HACK
        students will gain valuable skills as they will be working in a team to
        complete a specific task that requires diverse sets of skills.
